    "title": "Tail Calls in Rust",
    "content": "<p>The main transformation to enable tail calls is to replace the function call <code>f</code> with a <code>goto</code>, calling destructors on local variables, then replacing the original arguments of the current function with the arguments of <code>f</code>. The normal borrow semantics for the return should therefore apply.</p>

<p>A tail call is only valid if there is nothing to be done in the caller after the call. This implementation checks this by first creating a node for <code>become</code> in HIR, then later, in MIR, checks that the &ldquo;basic block being branched into&rdquo; either &ldquo;has length zero&rdquo; or &ldquo;terminates with a return.&rdquo; I assume that this &ldquo;basic block being branched into&rdquo; contains whatever follows the <code>become</code> statement, and branches to another basic block if there&rsquo;s anything more to do after the <code>become</code>; otherwise falling into the cases mentioned.</p>

<p>Also notes the main reason tail calls haven&rsquo;t been implemented yet: portability. They&rsquo;re not supported in several targets, like WebAssembly, which is something that the Rust developers apparently won&rsquo;t tolerate.</p>
