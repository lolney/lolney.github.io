    "content": "<p>Magic Pocket is Dropbox&rsquo;s distributed storage system. It prioritizes simplicity, durability and availability, with a multi-level design that uses centralized coordination where possible. Data is replicated on all levels: between zones (which span an entire region, like the Eastern US) but also within each zone. The <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11647343">author notes in a HN comment</a> the high-level similarities with GFS, which may warrant a closer look.</p>

<p>Below the level of <code>zone</code> is the <code>cell</code>, the largest storage unit with central coordination. The <code>cell</code> contains <code>volume</code>s, which are replicated over several physical storage units, or <code>OSD</code>s. The cell&rsquo;s <code>master</code> controls tasks like the creation and deletion of buckets, and repair of volumes in case of <code>OSD</code> failure. The data flow of the cell works independently of the master, though: a separate <code>replication table</code> maps buckets to physical storage locations, keeping it working in case of failure of the master. The master&rsquo;s protocol ensures consistency in the event of failure or restart of any component, notably by storing the <code>generation</code> of each volume-to-OSD mapping with the volume and in the replication table. Eg, if the master hangs in the middle of a repair process and later comes back to life, it will not try to continue that repair (or will at least not leave the system inconsistent - the exact mechanism that prevents that is unclear).</p>

<p>Some other characteristics: the smallest units of file storage are immutable, like git&rsquo;s or IPFS&rsquo;s: changes are written to a journal and each change creates a new block. This prevents inconsistency that could result from updating some copies of the file but not others. It&rsquo;s also optimizing for temporal locality &ndash; files that get changed are the most likely to get changed again soon &ndash; while making sure that even old files can be accessed quickly. It does this, per <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11646627">the author&rsquo;s comment on HN</a>, by applying the above replication scheme for 24 hours after a volume is created. After that, data is replicated by a more efficient erasure-coding system.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11646524">another interesting HN comment</a>, the author points out that the <code>block</code>s are actual blocks on the storage device, directly managed without any intermediate filesystem.</p>
