    "content": "<p>The log-structured merge tree is used in the storage engine of many databases, including Cassandra<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. It describes a data structure, often contrasted with B-trees, that&rsquo;s mainly designed as a strategy for managing writes to disk.</p>

<p>The basic approach is this: Maintain a collection of stores, increasing geometrically in size from the top down. Store records in the top level first. When level L_i fills up, merge it into L_i+1, emptying L_i.</p>

<p>Each level is itself a key-value store. Lower levels are implemented as B+ trees, filled in breadth-first order to avoid wasting space and allow for more sequential reads. Lookups proceed by checking for the key in L_0, then proceeding to the next level if the key isn&rsquo;t found.</p>

<pre><code>        [][][]               &lt;--- L_0: memory (updated in place)
      [][][][][][]           &lt;--- L_1: disk (updated with a merge)
[][][][][][][][][][][][]     &lt;--- L_2: disk (updated with a merge)
</code></pre>

<p>The log-structured approach contrasts with the update-in-place approach: while the former does sequential writes, relying on additional sequential IO to manage the structure asynchronously, the latter does random reads &ndash; relying on a single seek for each read.</p>

<p>The bLSM<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> authors note the choice that web services face when storing small objects: optimize for low-latency reads, or for high-throughput writes. B-trees meet the former requirement, and LSMTs meet the latter by making sure that all writes to disk are batched.</p>
