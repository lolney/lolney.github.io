Two of the most beloved courses at NU, Prof. Robby Findler&rsquo;s courses on Compilers and Programming Languages, are built on that principle: they are basically programming seminars, with very little formal introduction to the concepts they cover - instead letting them reveal themselves through the assignments. Indeed, a compiler isn&rsquo;t built the way it is because the concept of a &lsquo;compiler&rsquo; is written in natural law - it&rsquo;s a revealed way of handling the complexity that comes with all the forms the grammar of the language can express itself.</p>
