                <p>This paper is an overview of synchronization methods across the hardware stack, with an analysis that attributes high-level performance differences to low-level hardware constraints.</p>

<p>Among the key takeaways:</p>

<p>Latency of atomic operations: There is a heavy penalty for cross-socket sharing - ie, passing data between cores (or hyperthreads). This outweighs other sources of latency by far.</p>

<p>Locking vs message passing: Message passing is better when data has high contention, locking with low contention.</p>

<p>Performance of different types of locks: Each of the nine locks considered is the best performer in certain situations. The ticket lock is the best performer in most low-contention cases, though&ndash;the &ldquo;ticket lock&rdquo; being a spinlock that uses a FIFO queue to determine which thread is allowed to proceed.</p>

                <p>Here are some highlights for the Hacker News AMA of Alan Kay, pioneering researcher in graphical user interfaces and object-oriented programming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11940433">Part of this was that the rather good idea of parsing non-command messages in each process &ndash; we used this in the first Smalltalk at Parc &ndash; became much too ad hoc because there was not a strong attempt to intertwine a real language around the message structures (this very same thing happened with http &ndash; just think of what this could have been if anyone had been noticing</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Kay thinks that current message-passing protocols (like HTTP or Unix process communication) don&rsquo;t stand up well to the formal treatment of message-passing in Smalltalk. As background, Smalltalk&rsquo;s message handling was done by dynamic dispatch on objects. This would allow inheritance of message handling, so that, eg, the default implementation was to return <code>messageNotUnderstood</code>.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> There is perhaps also the advantage that message fields are parsed by the language parser, making it an actual component of the language that might allow, eg, for easier static analysis. I&rsquo;m only speculating on the specifics, though, since Mr. Kay doesn&rsquo;t make this part clear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=alankay1">&ndash; I was surprised that the HN list page didn&rsquo;t automatically refresh in my browser (seems as though it should be live and not have to be prompted &hellip;)
</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Kay comments earlier on the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11940276">&ldquo;worse is better&rdquo; vs &ldquo;better is better&rdquo;</a> approaches to user interface design, but this, I think, is a better, more concrete way of answering the question. Hacker News is itself an embodiment of &ldquo;worse is better&rdquo;, avoiding new features and maintaining <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11940044">what one commenter points out</a> is an &ldquo;old school&rdquo; feel. Mr. Kay counters with an interesting critique, saying that if old school means how things were done, eg, at PARC, that&rsquo;s more than this website can do! That&rsquo;s to say that old school software was often more capable than we give it credit for, not static, as we often imagine it, but experimenting with new modes of interaction just like fast-moving software today. We shouldn&rsquo;t, therefore, fold up new features simply because they wouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;old school&rdquo; enough, as if the researchers at PARC and Bell Labs achieved the perfect form of computing.</p>

                <p>Roofnet is a WiFi mesh network for increasing Internet access in urban areas. It&rsquo;s designed to be easy to set up: Users just need to place antennae on their roofs, and there&rsquo;s no need surveys to determine the optimum place to put them &ndash; since the network makes up the difference in performance. It does that, in part, though its routing protocol, which chooses routes that maximize bitrate and minimize loss-rate. It also introduces a new protocol that maximizes throughput no matter the loss rate &ndash; transmitting at a lower bitrate can improve performance by avoiding re-transmissions, and this protocol improves on the heuristics used by its predecessors (although not described in detail here).</p>

<p>In summary: Some number of nodes in the network have wired access to the Internet. The rest of the nodes need to route their packets to these gateway nodes, with some number of hops. Roofnet does that without much performance loss by choosing the highest-throughput routes, using multiple links if necessary.</p>

                <p>Magic Pocket is Dropbox&rsquo;s distributed storage system. It prioritizes simplicity, durability and availability, with a multi-level design that uses centralized coordination where possible. Data is replicated on all levels: between zones (which span an entire region, like the Eastern US) but also within each zone. The <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11647343">author notes in a HN comment</a> the high-level similarities with GFS, which may warrant a closer look.</p>

<p>Below the level of <code>zone</code> is the <code>cell</code>, the largest storage unit with central coordination. The <code>cell</code> contains <code>volume</code>s, which are replicated over several physical storage units, or <code>OSD</code>s. The cell&rsquo;s <code>master</code> controls tasks like the creation and deletion of buckets, and repair of volumes in case of <code>OSD</code> failure. The data flow of the cell works independently of the master, though: a separate <code>replication table</code> maps buckets to physical storage locations, keeping it working in case of failure of the master. The master&rsquo;s protocol ensures consistency in the event of failure or restart of any component, notably by storing the <code>generation</code> of each volume-to-OSD mapping with the volume and in the replication table. Eg, if the master hangs in the middle of a repair process and later comes back to life, it will not try to continue that repair (or will at least not leave the system inconsistent - the exact mechanism that prevents that is unclear).</p>

<p>Some other characteristics: the smallest units of file storage are immutable, like git&rsquo;s or IPFS&rsquo;s: changes are written to a journal and each change creates a new block. This prevents inconsistency that could result from updating some copies of the file but not others. It&rsquo;s also optimizing for temporal locality &ndash; files that get changed are the most likely to get changed again soon &ndash; while making sure that even old files can be accessed quickly. It does this, per <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11646627">the author&rsquo;s comment on HN</a>, by applying the above replication scheme for 24 hours after a volume is created. After that, data is replicated by a more efficient erasure-coding system.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11646524">another interesting HN comment</a>, the author points out that the <code>block</code>s are actual blocks on the storage device, directly managed without any intermediate filesystem.</p>

                <p>The skip list is an alternative to balanced search trees, especially suited for distributed applications. MemSQL is the main adopter, using skip lists as its primary index structure, but they&rsquo;re <a href="https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/unstable/src/t_zset.c#L31">also used in Redis</a> to implement ordered sets.</p>

<p>This image from the paper shows what the data structure looks like. A node contains k pointers, with the ith pointer pointing to the next node of level i:
<img src="/img/skip-list.png" alt="A skip list" />
When a node is inserted, it is given a random level to represent it: level 1 with 50% probability, 2 with 25%, etc. Searches are started at the top level, with each node acting as an index to the lower level. This process is like a binary search &ndash; if the skip list is balanced, the search traverses only 1-2 nodes at each level.</p>

<p>The paper defends the claims that 1) concurrency guarantees are easier to implement for skip lists than for balanced trees, requiring only write locks on the nodes being written, and 2) the data structure is very unlikely to become significantly unbalanced. With skip lists having the advantage of 1) and having similar performance to balanced trees, they appear to provide an advantage in concurrent applications.</p>

<p>To ensure that readers are not disrupted by writes in the absence of read locks, x is updated to point to its predecessor after removing x. Proofs are supplied for the correctness guarantees, among them that the list remains sorted and the lock is held only by the deleted key.</p>

<p>Although the worst case search time is O(n), in the case, for example, that the only node at each level i is the first node in the list at level 0, this is an unlikely outcome. The probability distribution over the comparisons required is similar to that of the number of coin flips needed to see k heads, where k is equal to the number of levels. Showing that distribution is apparently left by the authors as an exercise for the reader, but it makes intuitive sense: the most likely outcome is 1-2 comparisons on each level, corresponding to the most likely outcomes of 1 or 2 coin flips needed to see 1 head.</p>

                <p>This is a pretty neat showcase about customizing the touchbar on the latest Macbook Pros. It&rsquo;s appropriate that it begins with a picture of the author&rsquo;s super customized Linux desktop from 2007, because the last time I thought about this sort of thing was while reading &ldquo;show off your desktop&rdquo; threads in Macrumors threads c. 2007-2008. I wasn&rsquo;t aware that Applescript was so capable &ndash; it has super convient APIs for apps like Spotify and concise JSON fetching and parsing.</p>

<p>It sort of makes me want to get a MBP, even though my impressions of it have soured because of the constant negativity about it on Hacker News and elsewhere.</p>

                <p>This is an interesting &ndash; paraphrasing from the article &ndash; &ldquo;distillation of reinforcement learning research from the past two decades,&rdquo; approaching from a cognitive science perspective. It considers the paradigm of training a large (many parameter) model to build a representation of the environment and its future, then training a smaller controller model, which outputs actions, from that representation. The future model, they argue, is similar to the way that humans make decisions &ndash; by considering how their actions will affect the future.</p>

<p>The RNN part of the model uses an approach similar to the one that <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/sketch-rnn-demo">SketchRNN</a> does to predict future actions. It sends compressed version of the environment through a feed-forward RNN, taking, at each stage t, the hidden vector h<em>{t-1}, the action a</em>{t-1}, and an additional input z_{t-1}. z_t is a vector sampled from the mixture of Gaussian distributions output by a <a href="http://blog.otoro.net/2015/11/24/mixture-density-networks-with-tensorflow/">Mixture Density Network</a>.</p>

<p>These actions are generated by the final layer of the model, the controller, which takes h_t and z_t as input.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/worldmodels/worldmodels.github.io/master/assets/world_model_schematic.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Everything together" /></p>

<p>They conduct a variety of experiments using various combinations of the three layers, showing, eg, that the full model is better than just using the RNN as input to the controller.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that they can use the VAE to decode the latent vectors in the MDN-RNN model, giving a representation of the model&rsquo;s prediction of the future environment. After training the model only to learn this virtual representation, they can then train the M and C layers on it and apply it to the real environment.</p>

                <p>This blog post imagines a programming language with &ldquo;colored functions&rdquo; &ndash; function are either blue or red, and differently-colored functions cannot be passed to or called from each other, plus have different calling conventions &ndash; as an analogy for async functions. The point, I suppose, is to show the unwieldiness of interactions between async and code. After trying to navigate [futures in Rust for a while](), I can see the point. As the author notes, futures don&rsquo;t do much to solve the ugliness of the hand-off between sync and async code. There needs to ultimately be a method for handling separate independent callstacks.</p>

<p>One area where this manifests: API design. The API creator must decide whether to expose async functions, leaving sync users to de-async the result themselves, or sync functions, which async users are left to wrap (potentially wasteful, as the library had to do this itself at some point).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8984648">HN comments for this post</a> are insightful, with the top commenter noting that the red-blue language is &ldquo;essentially Haskell&rdquo; (with blue and red monoids), and another noting that golang solves this problem by making the whole program &ldquo;red&rdquo; (async).</p>

                <p>A lot of PL research is about better patterns of programming, covering new ways of abstracting patterns that you encounter in a real codebase. Two of the most beloved courses at NU, Prof. Robby Findler&rsquo;s courses on Compilers and Programming Languages, are built on that principle: they are basically programming seminars, with very little formal introduction to the concepts they cover - instead letting them reveal themselves through the assignments. Indeed, a compiler isn&rsquo;t built the way it is because the concept of a &lsquo;compiler&rsquo; is written in natural law - it&rsquo;s a revealed way of handling the complexity that comes with all the forms the grammar of the language can express itself.</p>
