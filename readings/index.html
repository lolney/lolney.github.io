<p>Short summaries of stuff I&rsquo;ve read (mostly technical blogs or papers) that don&rsquo;t deserve their own post:</p>

<h3 id="ipfs-interplanetary-file-system-proposal-paper-https-github-com-ipfs-ipfs-blob-master-papers-ipfs-cap2pfs-ipfs-p2p-file-system-pdf-raw-true"><a href="https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/blob/master/papers/ipfs-cap2pfs/ipfs-p2p-file-system.pdf?raw=true">IPFS (Interplanetary File System) Proposal Paper</a></h3>

<h4 id="3-27-208">3/27/208</h4>

<p>IPFS is a distributed file system. It combines ideas from Kademlia, Bittorrent, Git,and Self-Certified Filesystems, taking respectively 1) routing and node identity, 2) block exchange, 3) Merkle tree-based verification and versioning, and 4) self-certification - addresses derived from public keys.</p>

<p>The result is something like a DHT that stores Git objects and uses the Bittorrent protocol for distribution. The certificate system, which does not rely on a trusted 3rd party to map addresses to public keys, is another major feature, allowing public-key encryption and ensuring that a malicious node can&rsquo;t impersonate a node that has already established trust.</p>

<p>The block exchange protocol, called BitSwap, is a modified version of Bittorrent&rsquo;s. Bittorrent provides incentives for seeding - the standard seeding strategy is to prioritize seeding to the n peers that are themselves the best seeders. BitSwap is similar, but the choice of which peers to seed to is probabilistic, depending on that peer&rsquo;s ratio of sent:received objects. Since this probability is based on <em>lifetime ratios</em>, a peer can stop uploading for a short time and not have its download rates affected much.</p>

<p>Bittorrent also encourages the sharing of rare pieces by making sure that rare pieces are requested first. If this is a demand-side incentive - demand is increased for rare pieces - BitSwap&rsquo;s solution is supply-side - peers are encouraged to seek objects that their peers also want. This allows a peer to contribute even if it currently does not want any objects.</p>

<p>The file system itself is implemented as a Merkle DAG, very similar to Git&rsquo;s. Objects have links to other objects, represented as their hashes. <code>Tree</code> objects represent directories, <code>blob</code>s data, and <code>commit</code>s represent snapshots of a collection of objects in some state. IPFS, unlike git, also has <code>list</code>s, which can contain blobs or other lists. Like Git, objects are deduplicated because they are addressed by their hashes. They are also immutable and permanent: once mutated, an object&rsquo;s hash changes, and there is no command in the protocol to delete the previous version.</p>

<h4 id="3-23-2018">3/23/2018</h4>

<p>These attacks involve using DNS rebinding to allow a website to send requests to HTTP servers on a user&rsquo;s machine. The targets include RPC servers included with uTorrent and with Blizzard Updater.</p>

<p>DNS rebinding is meant to get around the same origin policy. The scheme is: setup a domain and a DNS server with a short TTL. Once that&rsquo;s expired, serve a script that makes a request to the origin domain - but when the browser makes a DNS request, respond with localhost instead. That way, the request gets routed to the target instead.</p>

<p>Each vulnerable app also failed to provide authentication that could prevent the attack. The Blizzard Updater included an auth token with each response, presumably setting Access-Control-Allow-Credentials to prevent bad actors from reading it - but DNS rebinding circumvented this.</p>

<h3 id="async-in-rust-https-aturon-github-io-apr"><a href="https://aturon.github.io/apr/">Async in Rust</a></h3>

<h4 id="3-22-2018">3/22/2018</h4>

<p>Asynchronous programming constructs allow you to reason about asynchronous operations without explicitly working with threads - the asynchronous library handles that itself, preventing unnecessary thread spawning. In Rust, these constructs are &lsquo;tasks.&rsquo; When you run a task, instead of blocking, it returns control to the executor thread. The task runs until it would block, then returns <code>Async::Pending</code>. You also provide it a <code>Waker</code> so that it can wake itself up again.</p>

<p>An executor works by running each of the tasks until they block, and then <code>park</code>ing. A <code>Waker</code> contains a link back to the executor and inserts the task in the executor&rsquo;s ready set before <code>unpark</code>ing it.</p>

<p>Futures are tasks that can be chained. They must implement a type Item that is the result of the computation, a type Error, and a poll method that returns <code>Async::WillWake</code> or <code>Async::Ready(data: Item)</code>.</p>

<p>Futures are designed to be state machines: eg, one that alterates between the states <code>Reading</code> and <code>Writing</code>, returning Async::NotReady when it can&rsquo;t proceed.</p>

<h4 id="3-20-2018">3/20/2018</h4>

<p>If you create a socket and call <code>connect(dst, port)</code> on it, or first call <code>bind(src, port)</code> with port 0, the kernel will allocate from the pool of up to 64k available ports. However, with with <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code>, you can also share ports to create an effectively unlimited number of connections - as long as the destination address is different for each connection sharing the same port. To have multiple connections to the same IP/Port pair, you can use different source IP addresses instead.</p>

<p><code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> behaves slightly differently than <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code>, allowing reuse of addresses in the cooldown period after a process releases a socket, plus allowing binding of wildcard addresses (<code>0.0.0.0</code>) and normal addresses to the same port.</p>

<p>There are various implementation concerns (ie, <code>bind</code> is fine, but after <code>connect</code> one of the reuse rules is broken) that the linked post discusses.</p>

<h4 id="3-15-2018">3/15/2018</h4>

<p>An overview for the reasons that more recent languages (Rust, Go) have avoided the full-on object-orientedness of Java, C#, et. al. Traits and interfaces allow for polymorphism while avoiding the problems of inheritance - they&rsquo;re not hierarchical, so they avoid issues like the diamond problem that result when implementing new objects that don&rsquo;t fit easily into the existing hierarchy. Non-hierarchical structs also avoid the bloat of carrying around unnecessary parent fields.</p>
