    "content": "<p>This is Brian Krebs&rsquo; fascinating investigative report into the Mirai botnet, the network used to launch some of the largest DDoS attacks on the Internet to date. Krebs&rsquo; account include testimony and private conversations with the hackers themselves, who were later charged by the FBI for their activities. It reveals how much the Internet remains a free-for-all, kill-or-be-killed world, where rogue security companies can surreptitiously hijack competitors&rsquo; IP addresses<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGP_hijacking">1</a> or take down their services with DDoS hits.</p>

<p>Mirai was the covert arm of a legitimate business, ProTraf Solutions, which offered DDoS protection services in the competitive Minecraft server cottage industry. In early attacks, it sought competitive advantage by DDoSing a competing service, ProxyPipe, which forced many of ProxyPipe&rsquo;s customers to switch to ProTraf.</p>

<p>Krebs is able to connect ProTraf CEO&rsquo;s description of his programming language skills to that of his blackhat persona &ndash; and professed Mirai author &ndash; Anna-Senpai. He also mentions a Github username, shared among a number of online accounts that includes a number of Minecraft forums and a Reddit account. This has several interesting posts, including awfully suspicious speculation about the nature of a DDoS attack on the Rutgers campus.</p>

<p>After the ProxyPipe CEO, remarkably, managed through several layers of ISPs to get the Ukrainian-based control servers for the botnet disconnected, Anna-Senpai taunts him with the knowledge he is responsible. This is just one piece of evidence for his petty-vindictive persona &ndash; he is constantly taking down people he gets into disagreements with, like a hapless server operator and, on multiple occasions, Krebs himself.</p>

<p>The ProxyPipe CEO evenutally makes the connection that Krebs describes between Anna-Senpai and his real life persona. In fact, the two had previously been friends and collaborators on Minecraft projects, before, he says, Anna-Senpai fell to the bad influence of places like Hackforums.net.</p>

<p>His sloppiness with his online personas and his hubris eventually does the Mirai creator in, as the FBI track him down after a broad investigation. He is indicted, and now, as of the time of writing, serves the FBI as part of a plea agreement.<a href="http://www2.philly.com/philly/business/mirai-cyberattack-rutgers-student-paras-jha-fbi-20180919.html">2</a></p>
