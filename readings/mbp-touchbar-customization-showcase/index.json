    "content": "<p>This is a pretty neat showcase about customizing the touchbar on the latest Macbook Pros. It&rsquo;s appropriate that it begins with a picture of the author&rsquo;s super customized Linux desktop from 2007, because the last time I thought about this sort of thing was while reading &ldquo;show off your desktop&rdquo; threads in Macrumors threads c. 2007-2008. I wasn&rsquo;t aware that Applescript was so capable &ndash; it has super convient APIs for apps like Spotify and concise JSON fetching and parsing.</p>

<p>It sort of makes me want to get a MBP, even though my impressions of it have soured because of the constant negativity about it on Hacker News and elsewhere.</p>
