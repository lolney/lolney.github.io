<p>HTTP/3 is the evolution of the HTTP standard with UDP. It’s based on a new transport-layer protocol called QUIC, which allows better parallelism of the features of HTTP/2.</p>

<p>HTTP/2 introduced multiplexing, which lets the browser send multiple requests without first waiting for the response. This appears parallel at the HTTP level, but it still relies on a single TCP connection. That means that any lost packet will hold up the chain of requests until that packet can be re-transmitted.</p>

<p>HTTP/3&rsquo;s solution continues to use a single connection, but allows transmission from other logical streams while waiting for a lost packet to be retransmitted. That requires implementing a new protocol that retains TCP’s features but allows more control over transmission of packets.</p>

<h2 id="streams">Streams</h2>

<p>QUIC brings HTTP streams to the transport layer. They are independently flow-controlled and independently head-blocked, with prioritization still done at the HTTP layer.</p>

<h2 id="ossification">Ossification</h2>

<p>Changing standards like TCP comes with costs: The Internet relies on a lot of intermediaries to survive, but many are not frequently updated — they will often drop packets on seeing TCP options that they don’t recognize. QUIC gets around this by operating purely with secure connections, preventing intermediaries from inspecting traffic.</p>

<p>This has been a problem with TCP Fast Open, the standard that allows sending data on the first handshake transmission. QUIC offers its own fast open handshake to address that.</p>

<p>Regardless, there are still barriers to using UDP as a transport - many routers block UDP traffic on the standard HTTP ports, for example. This means that HTTP/1 or /2 will still have to exist as a fallback and that connections to unknown hosts will have to be initiated that way.</p>

<h2 id="adoption">Adoption</h2>

<p>It’s already in use across much of the Internet - 7% of all Internet traffic in 2017. While the original Google-introduced protocol was just for HTTP, the IETF version includes a layer for non-HTTP protocols. The implementation for that is still in progress.</p>

<p>Adoption requires coordinating support among those who determine the path of the web, including browser vendors, Apache and nGinx, and TSL implementors.</p>
