Traits and interfaces allow for polymorphism while avoiding the problems of inheritance - they&rsquo;re not hierarchical, so they avoid issues like the diamond problem that result when implementing new objects that don&rsquo;t fit easily into the existing hierarchy. Non-hierarchical structs also avoid the bloat of carrying around unnecessary parent fields.</p>
