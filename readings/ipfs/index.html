    <div class="article-content">
      <p>IPFS is a distributed file system. It combines ideas from Kademlia, Bittorrent, Git,and Self-Certified Filesystems, taking respectively 1) routing and node identity, 2) block exchange, 3) Merkle tree-based verification and versioning, and 4) self-certification - addresses derived from public keys.</p>

<p>The result is something like a DHT that stores Git objects and uses the Bittorrent protocol for distribution. The certificate system, which does not rely on a trusted 3rd party to map addresses to public keys, is another major feature, allowing public-key encryption and ensuring that a malicious node can&rsquo;t impersonate a node that has already established trust.</p>

<p>The block exchange protocol, called BitSwap, is a modified version of Bittorrent&rsquo;s. Bittorrent provides incentives for seeding - the standard seeding strategy is to prioritize seeding to the n peers that are themselves the best seeders. BitSwap is similar, but the choice of which peers to seed to is probabilistic, depending on that peer&rsquo;s ratio of sent:received objects. Since this probability is based on <em>lifetime ratios</em>, a peer can stop uploading for a short time and not have its download rates affected much.</p>

<p>Bittorrent also encourages the sharing of rare pieces by making sure that rare pieces are requested first. If this is a demand-side incentive - demand is increased for rare pieces - BitSwap&rsquo;s solution is supply-side - peers are encouraged to seek objects that their peers also want. This allows a peer to contribute even if it currently does not want any objects.</p>

<p>The file system itself is implemented as a Merkle DAG, very similar to Git&rsquo;s. Objects have links to other objects, represented as their hashes. <code>Tree</code> objects represent directories, <code>blob</code>s data, and <code>commit</code>s represent snapshots of a collection of objects in some state. IPFS, unlike git, also has <code>list</code>s, which can contain blobs or other lists. Like Git, objects are deduplicated because they are addressed by their hashes. They are also immutable and permanent: once mutated, an object&rsquo;s hash changes, and there is no command in the protocol to delete the previous version.</p>
