<p>A few of my personal projects, sorted by some combination of recency and effort:</p>

<h3 id="tile-generator-https-github-com-lolney-tile-generator"><a href="https://github.com/lolney/tile-generator">Tile Generator</a></h3>

<p>A web app to generate tile maps from real-world data, using various data sources (mostly sourced from Google Earth Engine) that are stored and assembled with Postgis. Visualized on the frontend with React/leaflet.</p>

<h3 id="bottleneck-https-github-com-lolney-bottleneck"><a href="https://github.com/lolney/bottleneck">Bottleneck</a></h3>

<p>A multiplayer game, built with websockets, Node.js, and React, in which players manage their base by solving programming problems.</p>

<h3 id="rust-bittorrent-client-https-github-com-lolney-rust-bittorrent-client"><a href="https://github.com/lolney/rust-bittorrent-client">Rust BitTorrent Client</a></h3>

<p>An implementation of the BitTorrent spec in Rust &ndash; including a parser for bencoded objects &ndash; and a web client with a UI built with React/Redux. <a href="/posts/rust-bittorrent-client/">Writeup here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="vaporwave-planetary-surface-viewer-https-github-com-lolney-planetary-surface-visualizer"><a href="https://github.com/lolney/Planetary-Surface-Visualizer">Vaporwave Planetary Surface Viewer</a></h3>

<p>A WebGL project that shows what the solar cycle looks like at various points of the year on a planet with adjustable orbital parameters. E.g., on a planet with an orbital inclination of 90 degrees - tilted on its side - everywhere on the planet but the equator experiences polar night for some part of the year.</p>

<h3 id="zosterops-games-package-https-github-com-lolney-zosterops-games-suite"><a href="https://github.com/lolney/zosterops-games-suite">Zosterops Games Package</a></h3>

<p>Some silly games made in Unity, themed around a type of birds called white-eyes. The first one: navigate to the top of Mt. Kilamanjaro while freeing the white-eyes trapped in cages before a wandering cat gets to them. The second: a kind of tower defense game where you place obstacles to hinder the enemy (cats) while boosting your friends (white-eyes).</p>

<h3 id="world-climate-data-https-github-com-lolney-world-climate-data"><a href="https://github.com/lolney/World-Climate-Data">World Climate Data</a></h3>

<p>Maps monthly average high/low temperatures, based on interpolated and altitude-adjusted USGS station data.</p>

<p>While the data here is still useful, the code definitely needs a refresh - I may attempt to revive this at some point.</p>
