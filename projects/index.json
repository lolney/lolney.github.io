<p>Some of the projects I&rsquo;ve worked on in my spare time, in roughly descending order of seriousness.</p>

<h3 id="rust-bittorrent-client-https-github-com-lolney-rust-bittorrent-client"><a href="https://github.com/lolney/rust-bittorrent-client">Rust BitTorrent Client</a></h3>

<p>An implementation of the BitTorrent spec in Rust &ndash; including a parser for bencoded objects &ndash; and a web client with a UI built with React/Redux. Writeup on some of the implementation challenges coming.</p>

<h3 id="planetary-surfaces-https-github-com-lolney-planetary-surface-visualizer"><a href="https://github.com/lolney/Planetary-Surface-Visualizer">Planetary Surfaces</a></h3>

<p>Using a crude WebGL engine, shows what the solar cycle looks like at various points of the year on a planet with adjustable orbital parameters. E.g., on a planet with an orbital inclination of 90 degrees - tilted on its side - everywhere on the planet but the equator experiences polar night for some part of the year.</p>

<h3 id="world-climate-data-https-github-com-lolney-world-climate-data"><a href="https://github.com/lolney/World-Climate-Data">World Climate Data</a></h3>

<p>Maps monthly average high/low temperatures, based on interpolated and altitude-adjusted USGS station data.</p>

<h3 id="zosterops-games-package-https-github-com-lolney-zosterops-games-suite"><a href="https://github.com/lolney/zosterops-games-suite">Zosterops Games Package</a></h3>

<p>Some silly games made in Unity, themed around a type of birds called white-eyes. The first one: navigate to the top of Mt. Kilamanjaro while freeing the white-eyes trapped in cages before a wandering cat gets to them. The second: a kind of tower defense game where you place obstacles to hinder the enemy (cats) while boosting your friends (white-eyes).</p>
