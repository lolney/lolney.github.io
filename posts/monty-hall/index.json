    "title": "My take on the Monty-Hall Problem",
    "content": "<p>Monty-Hall is a simple problem that&rsquo;s attracted a disproportionate amount of controversy. It&rsquo;s originally formulated as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you&rsquo;re on a game show, and you&rsquo;re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what&rsquo;s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, &ldquo;Do you want to pick door No. 2?&rdquo; Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question is posed in a way that makes you think the answer is no, since you have a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> chance of winning whether you switch or not.</p>

<p>The key to thinking about it properly, which isn&rsquo;t really clear in the original formulation, is that the host won&rsquo;t open door 2 or 3 if he knows the car is behind it, but chooses uniformly at random between 2 and 3 if the car is in door 1. Working out the probabilities, it&rsquo;s then clear that switching to door 2 will give you a <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> chance of winning. Different interpretations may lead to different solutions.</p>

<p>In the equations below, $\Pr(C_i)$ denotes the probability that the car is in door $i$, while $\Pr(D_i)$ denotes the probability that the host opens door $i$. Here&rsquo;s the correct interpretation:
<div>
$$
P( C_1 \mid D_3)
= \frac{P(C_2 \wedge D_3)}{P(C_1 \wedge D_3) + P(C_2 \wedge D_3)}
= \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3}}
= \frac{2}{3}
$$
</div></p>

<p>By contrast, if $P( C_1 \mid D_1) = \frac{1}{3}$ &ndash; that is, the host always chooses door 3 when the car is in door 1, chooses door 3 when the car is in door 2, and chooses door 2 if the car is in door 3 &ndash; the probability of winning is now <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> whether you switch or not.
<div>
$$
P( C_1 \mid D_3)
= \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}}
= \frac{1}{2}
$$
</div></p>

<p>Now consider if the host chooses between doors 2 and 3 uniformly at random. The probability of winning outright is now <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> - the car is in the host&rsquo;s chosen door, so you can just choose that one. Then $P(C_2 \mid D_3 \wedge \neg C_3)$ is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> &ndash; either it&rsquo;s in door 1 and he chooses the wrong door or in door 2 and he chooses the wrong door, making the total prob. of winning still <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>$$
P(Winning) = P(picks correctly) + P(picks incorrectly \wedge guess correctly)
$$
$$
= P( C_2 \wedge D_2) + P( C_3 \wedge D_3) + P(C_1 \wedge D_3 \wedge \neg C_3) + P(C_1 \wedge D_2 \wedge \neg C_2)
$$
$$
= \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3}
$$</p>
