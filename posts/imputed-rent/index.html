  <h1>Imputed Rent <aside></aside></h1>
  <p><a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/economix/2013/09/03/taxing-homeowners-as-if-they-were-landlords/?referer=">https://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/economix/2013/09/03/taxing-homeowners-as-if-they-were-landlords/?referer=</a></p>

<p>Imputed rent captures the idea that homeowners, as landlords, implicitly collect rent from themselves, as renters. Like ordinary rental income, then, it ought to be included in the homeowners&rsquo; income, even if it&rsquo;s balanced out by an equally-sized expense. Although the concept is accepted, if imperfectly accounted for, in economic analysis - it&rsquo;s used by the Deparment of Commerce in the calculation of GDP<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:0"><a href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>, for instance - scanning the comments of the linked NYTimes article reveals that the concept is deeply offensve to the public. There are many tortured attempts to argue against the concept there,<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup> though some of them hit on a good point: imputed income does not just apply to homeownership, but to any kind of service you offered to yourself or to any use of your own property. I don&rsquo;t think, though, that this threatens the concept of imputed income in the first place - it speaks more to the difficulty in accounting for all the various types of it and the challenge to our intution that it presents. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">3</a></sup> Unpaid labor is not less valuable to the economy than paid labor, and neither is there more value made if you live in your neighbors&rsquo; house and they live in yours, each paying rent to the other.</p>

<p>It is still difficult to shake the feeling that housing is especially singled out in these analyses. Googling &ldquo;imputed [rent/income] of non-housing property,&rdquo; &ldquo;imputed income from car ownership,&rdquo; etc., turns up little discussion of the concept applied to non-housing property, the only results I found being <a href="http://stuartbuck.blogspot.com/2005/02/imputed-rental-income.html">a blogger&rsquo;s take</a> in a similar vein as the NYTimes comments. However, a discussion of &ldquo;rental income of persons&rdquo; on the BEA website does mention &ldquo;patents, copyrights, and rights to natural resources&rdquo;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">4</a></sup> in addition to housing. I did also manage to find a paper (1943)<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">5</a></sup> that considers, after introducing the subject with housing, &ldquo;the rental value of other owned durable goods such as automobiles, aeroplanes, refrigerators and the like.&rdquo; This same paper calculates the total imputed income from a variety of consumer goods - including automobiles, furniture, and radios - at 365 billion, compared to 1.8 trillion from imputed housing rent. Since housing prices have only risen (faster than inflation) since then,<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">6</a></sup> it seems the discussion is housing-focused for good reason - the housing stock represents most of the value of durable goods in the country.</p>

<p>In any case, any attempt to implement a tax on imputed rent in the United States faces a history of stiff resistance, by both the public and the courts, even to milder forms of taxation. Even estate taxes, applying to intergenerational transfers of wealth, are a contentious political issue, and they tax something that&rsquo;s more clearly income than imaginary tranfers of money to oneself. The Supreme Court has written<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">7</a></sup> that imputed rent does not consitute income, which does not allow it to be taxed under the Consitution - non-apportioned direct taxes (ones that aren&rsquo;t proportional to population) are prohibited under Article I, Section 2, Clause 3, only allowed to apply to income by the 16th amendment. In fact, when the income tax was only 7 yers old, the Supreme Court ruled in Eisner v. Macomber <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">8</a></sup> that stock dividends are not a form of taxable income, though that decision was eroded by later rulings.</p>

<p>Most importantly, an imputed rent tax would undermine the well-enshrined incentives for home ownership in the US - see Devon Zeugler&rsquo;s post on the subject.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> That such a tax is unthinkable here, but, as the NYTimes article mentions, is implemented is several European countries, reflects the possibility for vastly different models of home ownership than our own.</p>

One of the more off-base ones attempts to argue that the concept is bunk because the bank is the real owner of the house in some cases, but there are also a bunch of weird attmpts at argumetum ad absurdum by coming up with exapmles of imputed income (like &ldquo;[going] home and saw[ing] a slice of ham&rdquo;).
