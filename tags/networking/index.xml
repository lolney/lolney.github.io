      <description>Roofnet is a WiFi mesh network for increasing Internet access in urban areas. It&amp;rsquo;s designed to be easy to set up: Users just need to place antennae on their roofs, and there&amp;rsquo;s no need surveys to determine the optimum place to put them &amp;ndash; since the network makes up the difference in performance. It does that, in part, though its routing protocol, which chooses routes that maximize bitrate and minimize loss-rate.</description>

      <title>Bind Before Connect</title>

      <description>If you create a socket and call connect(dst, port) on it, or first call bind(src, port) with port 0, the kernel will allocate from the pool of up to 64k available ports. However, with with SO_REUSEPORT, you can also share ports to create an effectively unlimited number of connections - as long as the destination address is different for each connection sharing the same port. To have multiple connections to the same IP/Port pair, you can use different source IP addresses instead.</description>
