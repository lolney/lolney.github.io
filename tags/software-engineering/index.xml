      <description>Magic Pocket is Dropbox&amp;rsquo;s distributed storage system. It prioritizes simplicity, durability and availability, with a multi-level design that uses centralized coordination where possible. Data is replicated on all levels: between zones (which span an entire region, like the Eastern US) but also within each zone. The author notes in a HN comment the high-level similarities with GFS, which may warrant a closer look.
Below the level of zone is the cell, the largest storage unit with central coordination.</description>

      <description>An overview for the reasons that more recent languages (Rust, Go) have avoided the full-on object-orientedness of Java, C#, et. al. Traits and interfaces allow for polymorphism while avoiding the problems of inheritance - they&amp;rsquo;re not hierarchical, so they avoid issues like the diamond problem that result when implementing new objects that don&amp;rsquo;t fit easily into the existing hierarchy. Non-hierarchical structs also avoid the bloat of carrying around unnecessary parent fields.</description>
