      <description>Magic Pocket is Dropbox&amp;rsquo;s distributed storage system. It prioritizes simplicity, durability and availability, with a multi-level design that uses centralized coordination where possible. Data is replicated on all levels: between zones (which span an entire region, like the Eastern US) but also within each zone. The author notes in a HN comment the high-level similarities with GFS, which may warrant a closer look.
Below the level of zone is the cell, the largest storage unit with central coordination.</description>

      <title>IPFS (Interplanetary File System) Proposal Paper</title>

      <description>IPFS is a distributed file system. It combines ideas from Kademlia, Bittorrent, Git,and Self-Certified Filesystems, taking respectively 1) routing and node identity, 2) block exchange, 3) Merkle tree-based verification and versioning, and 4) self-certification - addresses derived from public keys.
The result is something like a DHT that stores Git objects and uses the Bittorrent protocol for distribution. The certificate system, which does not rely on a trusted 3rd party to map addresses to public keys, is another major feature, allowing public-key encryption and ensuring that a malicious node can&amp;rsquo;t impersonate a node that has already established trust.</description>
